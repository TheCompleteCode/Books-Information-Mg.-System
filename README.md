Category: Computer Science
Book Title: C++ Plus Data Structures

The information should be stored using linked lists. Create a linked list that represents “Category” as its nodes. Each node of “Category” contains a linked list of nodes represent “Books” belong to that category. A user must be given a list of operation to perform the following operations:

1. Add new Category or new book. 
2. Delete a category and all the books belong to that category. 
3. Delete a book. 
4. Print all. 

Searching: 

5. Search for a category or a book (Search should return both the information i.e. category and book.
6. Display search results on screen.
7. Ask user to save results in some output file. If user enters yes, then save search results to a text file named as “Book _Info”.
