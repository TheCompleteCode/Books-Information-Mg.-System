# Books-Information-Managment-System

Write a program in C++ to simulate a Book store’s database. A Book Store’s database stores information about each book. This information consists of book’s Category and Title.

For Example:

Category: Computer Science
Book Title: C++ Plus Data Structures

The information should be stored using linked lists. Create a linked list that represents “Category” as its nodes. Each node of “Category” contains a linked list of nodes represent “Books” belong to that category. A user must be given a list of operation to perform the following operations:

* Add new Category or new book. 
* Delete a category and all the books belong to that category. 
* Delete a book. 
* Print all. 
Searching: 
* Search for a category or a book (Search should return both the information i.e. category and book.
* Display search results on screen.
* Ask user to save results in some output file. If user enters yes, then save search results to a text file named as “Book _Info”.

You can uses classes or structures + pointers.
